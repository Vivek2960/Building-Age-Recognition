# Building-Age-Recognition
We can predict age of building just by adding an image. 
**Abstract:**
We propose a different method for automatically predicting
the age of buildings using satellite images. Our approach
involves a two-step process: firstly, learning distinctive
visual patterns associated with different building epochs at
the patch level, and secondly, aggregating the patch-level
age estimates to obtain a global prediction for the entire
building. We create datasets from various sources and
thoroughly evaluate our approach, examining its sensitivity
to parameters and assessing the ability of deep networks to
capture age-related visual patterns. The results
demonstrate the remarkable accuracy of our approach.
This Project represents an initial stride towards automating
the assessment of building age.

**INTRODUCTION**
This Case study behind this research is the automated
Prediction of real estate objects. The Prediction of building age
is a difficult task that takes into account many aspects (e.g.,
location, infrastructure, building size and condition etc.) and to
date is mostly performed manually by domain experts. The
most common approach for building age recognition is based
on basics of line and color on the building. Age information of
buildings is, however, often not available. The goal of this case
study is to Predict age from satellite image. We suggest that the
building age can be extracted by analyzing images showing the
external view of houses.
